# E-Commerce-with-Hive-And-Spark:

This is an E-Commerce Analytics project that leverages AWS Services like EC2, Containerization techniques like Docker, data warehouse (Apache Hive), Apache Sqoop and Apache Spark to create a database with and perform Analytics on it on the Cloud. 
We create an EC2 Linux Instance, set up Docker on it and create an image. We create an Ingestion Pipeline by ingesting data to HDFS via Apache Sqoop, and transfer the files to Hive. We process the data using Apache Spark and transfer the processed Parquet file to Hive.

## Tech Stack:

Pythom, Git, Command-Line, AWS EC2, Docker, Apache Sqoop, Apache Hive, Apache Spark, Scala, MySQL

## Places for improvement:

- Use Terraform to automate infrastructure creation
- Prepare an Interactive Dashboard
